// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Begin
INPUT 10, 5
SUM = 10 + 5
PRINT SUM
END

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Begin
OddOrEven
READ SUM
IF SUM/2 gives remainder
THEN Print "Odd"
ELSE Print "Even"
END

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Begin
Input n1,n2,n3,n4,n5
avg =(n1,n2,n3,n4,n5)/5
small n1
large n1
for i = 2 to 5
  if n1> ni then:
    small ni
  if n1< ni:then:
    large=ni
print avg
print small
print large

-- END --

The pseudocode starts by getting inputs for the 5 values
Next, the average of the 5 values is calculated
The fourth line iterates through the numbers
Within the iteration, there are 2 conditional statements that calculate the smallest and the largest values
The last three lines print the average, the smallest and the largest input
